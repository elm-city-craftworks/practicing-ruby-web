      <p><b>Getting better at software development can be hard work.</b> There is an endless sea of learning materials out there, but just figuring out what topics you should focus on could take up all of your time if you let it. Don’t fall into that trap, instead, let me do the legwork for you!</p>

        <p>As a <a href="http://rubybestpractices.com" target="_blank">published author</a>, a <a href="http://compleatrubyist.com" target="_blank">professional trainer</a>, and as someone who has built and maintained a very popular <a href="http://github.com/sandal/prawn">open source project</a>, <b>I’ve done so much research and practiced so many techniques over the last several years that I feel like my head is going to explode</b>.  But rather than letting that happen, it’d be better for both of us if I just gradually released all the things I’ve learned so that others can benefit from them.</p>

        <p>So here’s the deal: <b>If you give me $8/month, I’ll deliver a well-polished brain dump directly to your inbox on a weekly basis</b>. The topics I cover will help you get better at the Ruby language while improving your overall software development skills at the same time. You’ll also get access to a mailing list where you can talk with other subscribers about what you’ve been reading, and even interact with me from time to time.</p>

        <p>If that sounds good to you, then enter your email address via the form below. New articles will be posted every Tuesday starting on 2011-08-23, and archive support will be implemented by the end of August.</p>
