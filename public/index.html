      <p><b>Getting better at software development is hard work.</b> There is an endless sea of learning materials out there, but just figuring out what topics you should focus on could take up all of your time if you let it. Don’t fall into that trap, instead, let me do the legwork for you!</p>

        <p>As a <a href="http://rubybestpractices.com" target="_blank">published author</a>, a <a href="http://compleatrubyist.com" target="_blank">professional trainer</a>, and as someone who has built and maintained a very popular <a href="http://github.com/sandal/prawn">open source project</a>, <b>I’ve done so much research and practiced so many techniques over the last several years that I feel like my head is going to explode</b>.  But rather than letting that happen, it’d be better for both of us if I just gradually released all the things I’ve learned so that others can benefit from them.</p>

        <p>So here’s the deal: <b>If you give me $8/month, I’ll deliver a well-polished brain dump directly to your inbox on a weekly basis</b>. The topics I cover will help you get better at the Ruby language while improving your overall software development skills at the same time. You’ll also get access to a mailing list where you can talk with other subscribers about what you’ve been reading, and even interact with me from time to time.</p>

        <p>If that sounds good to you, then <a href="http://tinyurl.com/practicing-ruby-2" target="_blank">please give me your email address</a> so that I can let you know when the newsletter has officially launched. I expect that’ll be some time in August, but the exact date hasn’t been set yet.</p> 

        <p>-greg</p>

        <p>PS: This actually isn’t a brand new newsletter service, but instead <b>I’ve been dragged out of retirement by popular demand.</b> That means that there are <a href="http://blog.rubybestpractices.com" target="_blank">a ton of articles</a> that I’ve publicly released from our first volume that you can check out while you wait for the second edition to launch. Enjoy!</p>
