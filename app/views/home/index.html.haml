      Practicing Ruby exists to help you get better at your craft, not
      to get you to click advertisements or hire us as consultants. With
      that in mind, we don't just write about what is trendy; we focus on the
      things that will truly make you a better programmer. You will also find
      that Practicing Ruby articles are more polished than the average blog
      post in pretty much every imaginable way.

      Studying programming can be a lot of fun, but it is only a means to
      an end. You can't master your craft without making a meaningful impact
      on the world through your software. Knowing that, Practicing Ruby makes it
      easier for you to develop projects that solve real problems for real
      people. We carefully balance theory and practice to help you keep your
      feet on the ground.
