      %h2 A Weekly Ruby Journal That Will Blow Your Mind. 

      %p
        Getting better at software development can be hard work. There is an
        endless sea of learning materials out there, but just figuring out what
        topics you should focus on could take up all of your time if you let it.
        Donâ€™t fall into that trap, instead, let me do the legwork for you!
      %p
        As a subscriber to Practicing Ruby, you'll get access to well-polished 
        weekly brain dumps about topics that will help you become a better
        Ruby developer. You'll also be able to join a dedicated group of

        topics I'm writing about.
