Hello there!

You are now unsubscribed from Practicing Ruby. If you actually meant to cancel your subscription, you won't be billed further, and you won't receive further notifications about Practicing Ruby content. You are of course welcome to respond to this email with some feedback, but that's totally optional. It was awesome to have you as a subscriber, even if you're ready to move on now. 

But there's also a chance that you're receiving this email and DIDN'T intentionally cancel your account. If that's the case, I have some bad news and good news for you.

The bad news is that MailChimp's integration with Amazon Payments isn't great, and so it never updates people's expiration dates or card numbers unless they cancel their subscription and sign up again. There isn't a way for me to detect this, because Mailchimp handles your payment, not me. I would love to change payment providers, but it's tough to make the switch at this point, and so we're stuck with this problem.

The good news is that resubscribing is easy. You just need to click the link below, and it should take you through the same process as when you signed up for Practicing Ruby.

Once you've done that, within a couple minutes a webhook will fire and restore your access to practicingruby.com. If you run into *any problems at all* during this process, or if you have questions, you can simply respond to this email and I'll respond as soon as I can.

Thanks!
