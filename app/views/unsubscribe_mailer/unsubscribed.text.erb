Hello there!

You are now unsubscribed from Practicing Ruby. 
If you actually meant to cancel your subscription, 
you won't be billed further, and you won't receive 
further notifications about Practicing Ruby content. 
You are of course welcome to respond to this email 
with some feedback, but that's totally optional. 
It was awesome to have you as a subscriber, even 
if you're ready to move on now. 

But there's also a chance that you're receiving 
this email and DIDN'T intentionally cancel your 
account. If that's the case, I have some bad news 
and good news for you.

The bad news is that MailChimp's integration with 
Amazon Payments isn't great, and so it never updates 
people's expiration dates or card numbers unless they 
cancel their subscription and sign up again. There 
isn't a way for me to detect this, because Mailchimp 
handles your payment, not me. I would love to change 
payment providers, but it's tough to make the switch 
at this point, and so we're stuck with this problem.

The good news is that resubscribing is easy. You 
just need to click the link below, and it should take
you through the same process as when you signed up for
Practicing Ruby.

Once you've done that, within a couple minutes a 
webhook will fire and restore your access to 
practicingruby.com. If you run into *any problems at all* 
during this process, or  if you have questions, simply 
reply to this email and I'll respond as soon as I can.

Thanks!
