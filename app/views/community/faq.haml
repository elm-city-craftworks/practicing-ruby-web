    Thank you for subscribing to Practicing Ruby! As a new subscriber,
    you might be wondering how this newsletter works and what you can
    expect from it. I've jotted down some notes here to answer those
    questions.

  %p
    %b New articles will be released every Tuesday.
    The exact time they get released may vary, but I will aim for between 16:00 UTC and 20:00 UTC.

  %p
    %b There is an archive of all back issues.
    I think that newsletters that charge per-issue for backlog access are just being greedy, so as long as you're a paying subscriber, your access to the archives will always be available at no additional charge.

  %p
    %b There will be lots of community discussion features
    so that you can share your thoughts and questions about the articles with me
    and other subscribers. Currently we have a simple comment system in place,
    and you can also find Gregory in the #practicingruby channel on Freenode. The
    password for that channel is carnegiehall. More features will be added over time to
    make discussion a key part of what this service is all about.

  %p
    %b All articles will use the latest stable release of MRI, unless otherwise noted.
    At the time of writing (2011-10-30), that is Ruby 1.9.3. That having been said, most of the content
    will be relevant regardless of what Ruby version or implementation you are using day
    to day.

  %p
    %b If you are unhappy with Practicing Ruby in any way
    you can cancel your account and I'll provide a refund for your
    current month upon request.

      This newsletter is something that I really care a lot about, and I want to make an
      awesome service for my readers. If you have any questions, thoughts, or suggestions,
