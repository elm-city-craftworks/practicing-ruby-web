We just wanted to let you know that your credit card ending in
<%= @card.last_four %> will expire on
<%= "#{@card.expiration_month}/#{@card.expiration_year}" %>. Please update your
billing information by visiting the following URL and
clicking 'Update your credit card':

<%= billing_settings_url %>

If you don't update your card before it expires, the billing gremlins may
disable your account and that makes us sad. As always if you have any questions
or problems don't hesitate to contact us.
