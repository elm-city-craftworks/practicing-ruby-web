Shucks! Your last payment to Practicing Ruby didn't work!

We tried charging your card ending in <%= @charge.card.last4 %> which expires on
<%= "#{@charge.card.exp_month}/#{@charge.card.exp_year}" %>. If this card is no
longer valid, please update it by visiting the following URL and clicking
'Update your credit card':

<%= billing_settings_url %>

We will attempt to charge your card again in 7 days. If you aren't sure
why your payment failed, just reply to this email and we will look into it.
