Hello there!

You are now unsubscribed from Practicing Ruby. If you actually 
meant to cancel your subscription, you won't be billed 
further, and you won't receive further notifications about 
Practicing Ruby content. You are of course welcome to 
respond to this email with some feedback, but that's 
totally optional. It was awesome to have you as a subscriber, 
even if you're ready to move on now.

But there's also a chance that you're receiving this email 
and DIDN'T intentionally cancel your account. If that's the 
case, I have some bad news and good news for you.

The bad news is that MailChimp's integration with Amazon Payments 
isn't great, and so it never updates people's expiration 
dates or card numbers unless they cancel their subscription and 
sign up again. There isn't a way for me to detect this, because 
Mailchimp handles your payment, not me.

The good news is that we have switched to Stripe for payments,
which gives us the ability to make sure this problem will
never happen for you again. When you resubscribe, you'll
be able to update your billing information whenever you want,
and you'll also get a warning about any failed payments BEFORE 
your account is disabled, not afterwards.

To resubscribe, please visit the following link:
https://practicingruby.com/registration/restart

Once you've updated your billing information, your account should be 
reactivated immediately. But if you run into  *any problems at all* 
during this process, or if you have questions, simply reply to this 
email and I'll respond as soon as I can.

Thanks!
-greg
